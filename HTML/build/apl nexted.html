            <p class="paragraph">Michelson Runway, an EdTech accelerator program, partnered with G.A. S.F. to host a kickoff to their 2018 cohorts with a hackathon. I was about one of thirty attendees, and after compelling pitches from 9 representative companies, we self-sorted into groups of our choosing.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Myself and two others chose APL NextEd, and we worked with founder Kathleen Gibson ove the course of an eight-hour session. Though the attendees were a mix of designers and developers, the three on our team were all designers.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Our client has a cloud-based Education Management System (EMS), with two primary user groups: Administration and Faculty. For this project, we would focus our efforts on improving the experience for faculty members.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">First, we had a robust discussion about the platform, and Kathleen's goals. There was a lot to know about her product, the ecosystem and needs of varoius stakeholders. We made sure to take time to align her with our process as designers as well. For this, we emphasized an MVP approach to prioritize our work. We agreed to redesign the Registration and Faculty Profile areas, in specific.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">As designers, we also wanted to have some insight into users' needs and perspective, so we decided to do a targeted interview and usability test with a SME - me, in this case, since I have a background as an educator and have used various LMS and EMS platforms.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The biggest takeaways from our interview and test were _ and _. We used these insights as guiding points, and broke into areas of specialization to meet our goals within the time left:</p>

        <h3>Phase 5: The Redesign</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="left max-width-m">
        <h4>Regristration</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">The registration process was a multi-step journey, from choosing a username/password, to entering physical address, and even adding other information like professional activities and credentials. Some of these steps had a multi-column layout, which we thought to simplify by keeping things in one column, also achieving a clearer visual flow.</p>

      <div class="row margin-top">
        <div class="col-one-half">

            <p class="">Reimagined Create Account screen. Another benefit of this design pattern is that it would be responsive!</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="margin-top left max-width-m">
        <p class="paragraph">We also noticed that there was an incosistent design pattern: there was a progress bar that didn't show up on each page. This could be redesigned to provide a series of steps that would prepare a faculty member mentally for the scope of the process.</p>

      <div class="row margin-top">

          <div class="left top-paragraph">
            <p class="">Based on feedback in the testing phase, we felt that there was redundant info - "complete your profile" and "Please complete the following...".</p>

        <h4>Profile</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">The profile page had a few clear issues - multiple navigation menus, which would change depending on what you clicked. We did some affinity mapping with input from our SME and client, and found some opportunity to simplify the content strategy, as well as have a consistent, persistent navigation that would clearly highlight which page was active.</p>

      <div class="max-width-m">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">We met and quickly reviewed options for making handoff of design to development clearer, and more efficient. We chose Zeplin, a cloud-based plugin for Sketch that would always have the most up to date version readily available for all.</p>

          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <div class="row margin-bottom max-width-l">
          <div class="col-one-half">
            <p class="paragraph">I loved the gritty nature of this project, from the subject matter to the challenge of designing on a slim budget and timeline. What still lingers in the months afterwards, are the two things mentioned earlier in this case study - design/development sync and validation through a formalized research and testing process.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-one-half">
            <p class="paragraph">Ideally, my first priority would be to go on site, and see how well we did and what could be improved. I would chat with the counselors about their needs and how the current build is working for them. I would also observe the clients completing the assessment, and get their thoughts about the experiencs, and document the sessions. Lastly, I would advocate that executive stakeholders were in the room to see for themselves, and make the best case for any needed improvements in another round of design.</p>
